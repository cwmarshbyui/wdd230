        <h2 class="center">Why Plural Marriage</h2>
        <h3>Let's get our minds right. God's will and God's timing.</h3>
        <p>
            First, I would turn your attention to the following scriptures. I know you know this but it’s a good
            starting point.
        </p>
        <p class="script">
            And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time that he should come in his
            glory—yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the elements should melt
            with fervent heat, and the earth should be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should
            pass away;<br>3 Nephi 26:3
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to the remaining righteous Nephites he expounded all things.
        </p>
        <p>
            But later, Mormon writes this.
        </p>
        <p class="script">
            Behold, I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade
            it, saying: I will try the faith of my people.<br>3 Nephi 26:11
        </p>
        <p>
            So that is a reminder that we won’t get all the answers until after a trial of our faith. Remember what the
            angel told Adam.
        </p>
        <p class="script">
            And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto
            the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.<br>Moses 5:6
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice it says, “many days”. I think Adam lived nearly one thousand years. But, after those “many days” Adam
            gets an answer.
        </p>
        <p class="script">
            And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the
            Father, which is full of grace and truth.<br>Moses 5:7
        </p>
        <p>
            The bottom line is we need to be open to God's will.
        </p>
        <p class="script">
            ...dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the
            trial of your faith.<br>Ether 12:6
        </p>
        <h3>However, let's remember we are commanded to learn the mysteries.</h3>
        <p>We might interpret the above to mean that learning the mysteries is not something to which
            we should aspire. That does not appear to be the case.
        </p>
        <p class="script">
            For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the
            power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times
            to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round.<br>1 Nephi 10:19
        </p>
        <p>I think it's good to remember that the Lord doesn't always move his work forward in the same way.
